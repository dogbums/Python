Input:      Expected output:      Actual result:
0           Minutes used: 0       0
            Basic charge: £0.00   £0.00
            VAT:          £0.00   £0.00
            Total:        £0.00   £0.00

1           Minutes used: 1
            Basic charge: £0.15   £0.15
            VAT:          £0.03   £0.03
            Total:        £0.18   £0.18



2           Minutes used: 2
            Basic charge: £0.30   £0.30

Calculations:

Basic charge = Minutes used x 0.15 (charge per minute)

VAT = Basic charge x 0.2 (20%)

Total = Basic charge + VAT

Reasoning for testing:

Inputting 0: To ensure that the integer 0 would still produce
a result, despite being neither positive or negative

Inputting 1: To easily test the outputs with the most simple input
and therefore the most simple results to analyse

Inputting 2: To ensure that all the values from the previous
calculation have doubled and therefore must be correct
